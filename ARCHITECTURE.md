# Budget Buddy Architecture

Budget Buddy uses a feature-based Next.js App Router structure. Routes compose
pages, features own product-specific behavior, and shared backend
infrastructure is isolated from browser code.

## Directory responsibilities

```text
src/
├── app/       Route files, layouts, loading states, and error boundaries
├── features/  Product features and their interactive boundaries
├── shared/    Shared components, types, and utilities
└── server/    Server-only infrastructure, data access, and generated clients

prisma/
├── schema.prisma
└── migrations/
```

## Route boundary

Files under `src/app` should remain small. A route should authenticate, load
the data needed by the page, and compose feature components. Business logic,
database queries, and large interactive components should live outside the
route tree.

## Feature boundary

Each directory under `src/features` owns one product capability:

```text
features/transactions/
├── components/
│   ├── transaction-form.client.tsx
│   ├── transactions-manager.client.tsx
│   └── csv-import-wizard.client.tsx
├── transaction.actions.ts
├── transaction.queries.ts
└── transaction.validation.ts
```

The `.client.tsx` suffix is a project convention that makes interactive React
boundaries visible. These files use the `"use client"` directive because they
need state, event handlers, browser APIs, or client-side hooks.

Feature modules can add files such as:

```text
account.actions.ts      Thin Next.js Server Actions
account.queries.ts      Server-only read operations
account.validation.ts   Input schemas and validation
account.types.ts        Types local to the accounts feature
```

## Server boundary

`src/server` contains modules that must never enter a browser bundle:

```text
server/
├── auth/
│   ├── constants.ts
│   └── session.ts
├── db/
│   └── client.ts
└── generated/
    └── prisma/
```

Modules that use secrets, cookies, password hashes, or the database import
`server-only`. This turns an accidental import from a Client Component into a
build error.

Database reads and writes should eventually go through server-only feature
queries or a data access layer. Every financial operation must obtain the
authenticated user on the server and scope database access by that user's ID.

## Shared code

Use `src/shared/components` for visual building blocks that are shared by
unrelated features. Use `src/shared/utils` for small framework-independent
helpers such as currency formatting, CSV parsing, and class-name composition.

Avoid turning `shared` into a catch-all directory. Code that only makes sense
for one product feature belongs with that feature.

## View models

`src/shared/types/view-models.ts` contains presentation contracts shared across
multiple features. Feature-specific query result types remain colocated with
their server-only query modules.
